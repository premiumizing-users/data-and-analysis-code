# premiumizing-users

This repository contains code and data (as can be made available) for the research project "Premiumizing Users". The data for this research project are subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the industry partner as it contains sensitive customer and company information. Please note that identifying information such as game, company, and product names were removed from the code displayed here for confidentiality reasons.

We are further unable to make user-level data publicly available as these might be deemed personally identifiable information (PII) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The company operates in these territories. Instead, we provide the data aggregated to the segment-level as mean and standard deviation for all variables / columns contained in the original data. The individual experiment folders contain these aggregated / blinded datasets for the respective experiment(s), the SQL code used to pull the data from the company's database, and the R code used to prepare the raw SQL data for further processing.

The R code used for analysis can be chiefly found in the file main_analysis.R in the main repository folder. This file also contains the randomization checks for Experiments 1, 2, and 3b (Web Appendix WA2). The analysis and randomization checks for the price path sub-experiments along days of the user experience (Experiment 3a) can be found in the sub-folder for that experiment and not in the main analysis file. In addition, there is a folder showing the code and data for the merging of the GDP per capita data and the code for the non-parametric assessment of heterogeneous treatment effects in device memory and GDP per capita (Section 6.3 and Web Appendix WA7 of the paper).

Please reach out to the authors in case of questions.
